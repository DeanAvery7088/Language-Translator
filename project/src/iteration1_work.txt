Iteration 1 division of labor:

Dean Avery aver0002 & Kevin Wang wang3224

We began iteration one with Dean dissecting and building test cases for scanner_tests.h
and Kevin beginning development of the scanner.  Upon Kevin getting our initial scanner
operational we implemented pair-wise programming to work out the kinks; at which point 
each made contributions to all components. For example, Kevin building test cases
and Dean streamlining and building functationality into scanner.cpp.
