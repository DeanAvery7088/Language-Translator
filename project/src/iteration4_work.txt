Iteration 4 division of labor:

Dean Avery aver0002 & Kevin Wang wang3224

For iteration 4, Dean began by modifying the makefile while Kevin began working on the AST.h cppCode.  
Thereafter, we implemented pairwise programming throughout with both working in conjunction and making
substantial contributions on all parts: AST.h, Matrix.cpp, Matrix.h, testing of all sample programs,
creation of my_codes, and the 15 extra credit points.
